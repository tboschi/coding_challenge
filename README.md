# Coding challenge by SG

The solutions to problems 1-6 are structured as the `coding_challenge` package.
Each problem has its own module, named `problemX`, where `X` is the problem number.
The method `solve` is available in each module and it returns the correct answer.

All problems can be tested at once with
```
python test.py
```
which not only prints the answers to each problem, but also the execution time.
